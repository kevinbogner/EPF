# ðŸ’¾Data Analysis of Consensus Clients

This project is created as part of the third cohort of the [Ethereum Protocol Fellowship (EPF)](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/program-guide/program-details.md).

The aim is to provide a **Data Analysis of the Consensus Clients landscape to statistically identify inconsistency, seeking to improve the Consensus Layer.**

## Overview

ðŸ’¾ **Check Out the Website: https://kevinbogner-data-analysis-consensus-clients-app-lz484x.streamlitapp.com/. Still super early stage.**

For now, the primary sources of the data are [blockprint](https://github.com/sigp/blockprint) for client data and https://beaconcha.in/ for reward data.

**[11/02/2022]**
- Continue working on a [Lighthouse Issue](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3672).

**[11/01/2022]**
- Attended [Office Hours Call #1](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/issues/41).
- Started working on a [Lighthouse Issue](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/3672) to add a guide for running a full node to the doc.

**[10/31/2022]**
- Attended EPF standup call and got some advice on handling big codebases in open-source projects. Focus on small areas; don't try to understand everything and familiarize yourself with testing.
- Installed and set up Linux for [Lighthouses' development environment](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/setup.html).

**[10/30/2022]**
- Published [Dev Update #3](https://hackmd.io/@lODlsf2CR9uWlyIyEdjjPQ/HJhEF6wVj).

**[10/28/2022]**
- Continue working on Dev Update #3, which I will finish this week.
- Researching validator rewards because that's the next thing I will be working on: [Ben Edginton's book](https://eth2book.info/bellatrix/part2/incentives/rewards) and [Pintail's guide](https://pintail.xyz/posts/modelling-the-impact-of-altair/).
- Meanwhile, I continue setting up my [Lighthouse node](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), so I can start experimenting with APIs once my Dev Update is published. [Checkpoint sync](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/checkpoint-sync.html?highlight=purge#automatic-checkpoint-sync) is done, and now the node is [reconstructing states](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/checkpoint-sync.html#reconstructing-states).

**[10/27/2022]**
- Started working on Dev Update #3.
- Listened to [Ethereum Core Devs Meeting #148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQfEW8LdE88).

**[10/26/2022]**

- Setting up [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse).
- Experimenting with [Lighthouse API](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/api.html).
