# 🍴 Project - Forkchoice

Forkchoice is a project created as part of the third cohort of the [Ethereum Protocol Fellowship (EPF)](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/program-guide/program-details.md).

## Overview

This project is a **Data Analysis of Consensus Clients to statistically identify peering issues, aiming to improve communication at the Consensus Layer.**

Based on the data provided users could come to conclusions such as:

> *Nodes by X* mainly voted for the orphaned block, while *Nodes by Y* voted for the canonical block.

> In many instances, the voting process of *Nodes by X* is delayed if the block was proposed by *Nodes by Y*.

These data points might help to further improve the communication among Consensus Clients.
