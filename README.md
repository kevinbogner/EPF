# ðŸ’¾Data Analysis of Consensus Clients

This project is created as part of the third cohort of the [Ethereum Protocol Fellowship (EPF)](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/program-guide/program-details.md).

The aim is to provide a **Data Analysis of the Consensus Clients landscape to statistically identify inconsistency, seeking to improve the Consensus Layer.**

## Overview

ðŸ’¾ **Check Out the Website: https://kevinbogner-data-analysis-consensus-clients-app-lz484x.streamlitapp.com/. Still super early stage.**

For now, the primary sources of the data are [blockprint](https://github.com/sigp/blockprint) for client data and https://beaconcha.in/ for reward data.
